        <h3>RETENTION</h3>
        <p>
          We will retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to
          provide the Services. We will retain and use your information as
          necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
          enforce our policies. Retention periods will be determined taking into
          account the type of information that is collected and the purpose for
          which it is collected, bearing in mind the requirements applicable to
          the situation.

        <h3>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
          We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
          to help prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of your
          Personal Information. Your information is stored on secure servers and
          isn’t publicly available. We limit access of your information only to
          those employees or partners that need to know the information in order
          to enable the carrying out of the agreement between us.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept
          confidential, no security system is infallible and impervious, and we
          cannot absolutely guarantee its security. You should be aware that
          there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over
          the internet. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we
          cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your Personal
          Information or other content you transmit using the Service, and you
          do so at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to help us prevent unauthorized access to your account by
          protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your
          account (for example, by signing off after you have finished accessing
          your account). You will be solely responsible for keeping your
          password confidential and for all use of your password and your
          account, including any unauthorized use.
        </p>

          Our Service is intended for use by persons over the age of majority
          (as determined by applicable laws where such persons reside in: “Age
          of Majority”), unless we are provided with a valid parental or
          guardianship approval and consent, in accordance with the requirements
          of applicable laws. Under no circumstances should the Service be used
          by persons under the Age of Majority. We will not knowingly collect
          Personal Information from any person under the Age of Majority unless
          as described herein, and at our sole discretion. If you discover that
          a child has been using the Service without your consent, or that
          someone has been using the Service for or on behalf of your child
          without your consent, please contact us using the information below
          under “How to Contact Us” and we will take reasonable steps to delete
          the child’s information from our active databases. ReinObs reserves
          the right to check its user base from time to time and remove users
          whom ReinObs has grounds to believe they are in fact minors,
          including without limitation, restricting those user accounts, or
          deleting them, as ReinObs may deem appropriate.
